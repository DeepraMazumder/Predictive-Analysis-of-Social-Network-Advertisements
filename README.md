# Predictive Analysis of Social Network Advertisements

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict user interactions with advertisements on social networks. By analyzing user demographics and ad-related data, the model predicts whether a given user is likely to click on a social media advertisement, helping businesses optimize their ad campaigns.

## Introduction

Online advertising on social media platforms has become a critical marketing tool for businesses. However, ensuring the right audience engagement can be challenging. This project aims to address this issue by using machine learning techniques to predict whether a user will engage with an advertisement based on user data such as age, gender, and estimated salary.

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their demographic profile. This can assist marketers in targeting the most relevant users, improving ad efficiency and increasing conversions.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying relevant features such as age, gender, estimated salary, and other demographics.
3. **Model Building**: Applying classification algorithms to predict ad engagement.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model’s accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains user demographic information, including:
- **Age**: User's age
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Estimated Salary**: User's estimated annual salary
- **Clicked on Ad**: Binary feature indicating whether the user clicked on the advertisement (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive-Analysis-of-Social-Network-Advertisements.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Predictive-Analysis-of-Social-Network-Advertisements
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removing any missing values and standardizing the input features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between the features and the target variable.
3. **Feature Selection**: Using correlation and statistical methods to select the most relevant features.
4. **Model Selection**: Trying different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to determine the best performer.
5. **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

## Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set, with the following performance metrics:
- **Precision**: X
- **Recall**: X
- **F1-Score**: X
- **ROC-AUC Score**: X

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Features**: Integrating additional features such as user behavior, device type, and time of day could improve model accuracy.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing the model’s parameters.
3. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the model using a web interface or cloud service to provide real-time predictions.
